## write a program to check if a number is divisible by 5 or 7
# n = int(input("enter number "))
# if (n%5==0) and (n%7==0):
#     print(n, "is divisible by 7 and 5")
# else:
#     print(n, "is not divisible by 7 or 5")

##  or
# n=int(input("enter a number "))
# if (n%7==0) and (n%5==0):
#     print(f"The number {n} is divisible by 5 and 7")
# else:
#     print(f"the number {n} is not divisible by 5 or 7")
